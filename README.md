# Code to be shared with the university of Exeter. The files in this repo are taken from a pull request I made for the open-source IMPROVER repository (https://github.com/metoppv/improver). The full commit is https://github.com/metoppv/improver/pull/2030/files and the files here are a subset of the original commit as acceptance tests have been discluded for brevity.

The files show the calculation of a gradient for a variable between two different height levels where the height levels may be expressed as height above ground level, above sea level or pressure levels. The accompanying file provides the unit tests for this file.
